## Reflection â€“ Module 7A

### 1. What part of the code was most confusing and why?
The most confusing part is how 'setInterval' repeatedly calls a function in the background. It is tricky at first to understand how the loop ends with 'clearInterval'.

### 2. How does the animation help visualize asynchronous behavior?
The animation shows that JavaScript can update the page over time without freezing the browser. While the loop runs, the browser stays interactive and updates the visuals every 500ms.

### 3. What did you change or improve, and what effect did it have?
I removed the emoji frames and replaced them with ".", "..", and "..." for a more simple and custom feel. I also added a background color change when the animation finishes. It gives a clearer "done" signal and makes the ending more noticeable.
